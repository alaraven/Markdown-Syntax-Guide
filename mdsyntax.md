- ***Backquotes** are used when entering **code** (\`). Anything within the quotations will not be effected by the markdown rules and shows up in red. The markdown result will be shown below the code.*
- *For a **block of code (multi-line)** you can use (```) at the beginning and end of the code.*
- To ignore special characters you can use a `\` before the character so it is not effected by md. Similar to how it is used in other programming languages.
- `---` *This is used to create the **Horizontal Rule** throughout the document. 
   ie. the line below this text.*
